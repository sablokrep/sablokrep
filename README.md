- 2010-2021: Plant, Bacterial, Fungi: RNASeq, GenomSeq, Genome Annotation, Phylogenomics, Comparative Genomics using Illumina, PacBio Sequencing, SoftwareDev. 
- 2021:2023: Machine Learning, SoftwareDev. 
- 2024: PanGenome, SoftwareDev. 
- 2025: Variant  and RNA-Seq Human Genomics, SoftwareDev  
- I work the areas of RNA-seq and Single cell, Metagenomics and Pangenomics covering all species and provide bio-software development, bioinformatics, machine and deep learning for Illumina and LongRead sequencing technologies.
- I have a background in bioinformatics and extensive programming experience (prior to 2021 - C++, Bash, R - after 2021: Bash, Python, RUST) covering bioinformatics, machine and deep learning and web and application development.
- 2025-2025: I worked as Area Expert at Instytut Chemii Bioorganicznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk, Poland, and worked on human genomics and developed computational approaches and softwares for human genomics.
- 2024-2024: I worked at Universitat Potsdam, Germany, where I sdevelop approaches for pangenomes, machine and deep learning. There, I did the PacBioHifi genome analysis for pangenome and created a complete HMTL, CSS, Javascript enabled web.
- 2017-2021, I worked as a Postdoctoral researcher at the Finnish Museum of Natural History and the University of Helsinki, conducting research on genome bioinformatics and sequencing the genomes of lower plants, including Coleochaete orbicularis, Blasia pusilla, Chaetospiridium orbicularis, Polytrichum commune, Mallomonas, and Cryptomonas species and developing the bioinformatics and software for the HPC and museum. My work has been focused on genome assembly, genome annotation, chloroplast genomics, and a variety of other topics. Additionally, I've worked for various other organisations, such as Edinburgh UK, to analyse the genomics data for PAFTOL species and the chloroplast genomes of the Ambrosia clade from Norway. Since 2019, my research has shifted to examining the genomes of fungi whose species have been sequenced using NextSeq methods. This work is currently concentrated on genome assembly, annotations, markers genes, and phylogenomics of those fungi.
- 2017 -2021: I have assembled, annotated, and identified ITS and other phylogenomics markers, as well as performed alignments, phylogenies, and downstream analyses on the fungal genomes of over 500 different species. The bioinformatics application of high throughput sequencing and methods to comprehend the biological and functional importance of the genes,evolution, and pathways in plants have been the main areas of my research up to this point.
- 2016-2017: University of Connecticut, USA, where i analyzed the Douglas fir genome from the genome annotation to the phylogenomics and identifying genes and evolution of importance.
- 2014-2016: I spent two years (2014–2016) as a Research Fellow at the University of Technology, Sydney, Australia, where I developed computational methods for understanding seagrasses and computing cluster.
- 2011-2014: After my PhD, I developed bioinformatics methods and software for transcriptional and post-transcriptional genomics across nuclear and organelle genomes at Fondazione Edmund Mach (Italy). I analyzed and finished multiple RNA-seq and organelle-Seq experiments for several plant and fungal species, including Arundo donax. Additionally i analyzed multiple metagenomics anlaysis coming from the fungal and bacterial species involving ITS metagenomics, as well as the bacterial metagenomics. Additionally, I have done a lot of work in the field of organelle genomics and have published the first Cardamine species chloroplast genomes.
